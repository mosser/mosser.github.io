### Join the lab!

I am always interested in having motivated students join the lab to work on exciting projects. From a recruitment point of view, I am more interested in motivation and excitement than by excellence in your transcript (I was myself a terrible B.Sc. student). If you're interested in joining the lab as a graduate student or postdoc, feel free to drop me an introductory email, mentioning which recent research work I've conducted excites you the most.
