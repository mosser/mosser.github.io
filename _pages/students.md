### Join the team!

I am always interested in having motivated students join the lab to work on exciting projects. From a recruitment point of view, I am more interested in motivation and excitement than by excellence in your transcript (I was myself a terrible B.Sc. student). If you're interested in joining the lab as a undergrad engineering student, a graduate student or a postdoc, feel free to [drop me an introductory email](mailto:mossers@mcmaster.ca?subject=Prospective Student).

If you're interested in Software Engineering, Safety, Certification from the lens of model-driven engineering, you should also have a look at [McSCert recruiting page](https://mcscert.mcmaster.ca/research/recruiting/), where we list all the opportunities (postdoctoral, doctoral and master students) available at the lab level.

### Open Positions (2024-2025)

  - PhD in Software Engineering (open topics)
  - M.Eng. in software engineering (microservices, justification models)
  - Bachelor research assistantships (language server)

**Please do not send a generic email stating that my expertise in AI and Machine Learning (which I don't have by the way) will be beneficial for your thesis project. Also, please do not apply for positions that I don't have (e.g., if this webpage states that I don't have any MSc position opened, there is no need to apply for such a position with me as a supervisor.)**
