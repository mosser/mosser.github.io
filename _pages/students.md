### Join the team!

I am always interested in having motivated students join McScert to work on exciting projects. From a recruitment point of view, I am more interested in motivation and excitement than by excellence in your transcript (I was myself a terrible B.Sc. student). If you're interested in joining the lab as a undergrad engineering student, a graduate student or a postdoc, feel free to [drop me an introductory email](mailto:mossers@mcmaster.ca?subject=Prospective Student).

If you're interested in Software Engineering, Safety, Certification from the lens of model-driven engineering, you should also have a look at [McSCert recruiting page](https://mcscert.mcmaster.ca/research/recruiting/), where we list all the opportunities (postdoctoral, doctoral and master students) available at the lab level.

### Open Positions (2024-2025)

  - PhD in Software Engineering (open topics related to software engineering)
  - M.Eng. in software engineering (DevOps, Microservices)

**Please do not apply for positions that I don't have, or send generic emails unrelated to my research interests. Actually, mentionning in your introduction email that you are a cat or a dog person (ar any other specific fun fact about you) will clearly indicate you have read this page, and your email will receive specific attention.**
