I've joined McMaster University and its Faculty of Engineering as an Associate Professor of Software Engineering in the [Department of Computing and Software](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas) (CAS) and a member of [McMaster Centre for Software Certification](https://www.mcscert.ca/) (McSCert). I am also a licensed engineer (PEng) in Ontario. When working from home, lectures or Zoom calls might be interrupted anytime because cats would play with the webcam wires. I am also quite good at breaking software and information systems. And if we ever have to travel together, be prepared for flight cancellations.


My main research effort since I joined McSCert is focused on the development of jPipe, a domain-specific language dedicated to the modelling and operationalization of _justification diagrams_. More generally, my research interests are related to software engineering, and more specifically, software composition, domain-specific languages and modelling in general. In addition, I apply my research to various domains such as machine learning pipelines, distributed systems, DevOps and safety. My research has been conducted closely with industrial partners and has led to several technological transfers.


I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Université de Nice (France) in 2010. I was a postdoctoral student at Inria Lille-Nord Europe in 2011 before joining SINTEF (Oslo, Norway) as a research scientist. I then joined Université Côte d'Azur in 2012, where I was Assistant and then Associate Professor, in charge of the Master of Software Architecture. Before joining Mac, I was Associate Professor of Software Engineering at Université du Québec à Montréal from 2019 to 2021.
